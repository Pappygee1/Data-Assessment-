Assessment Questions

Since you haven't provided specific assessment questions, I'll demonstrate some common SQL queries that would be useful for analyzing this financial plans data:
1. Count of Plans by Type
sql

SELECT 
    plan_type_id, 
    COUNT(*) as plan_count
FROM 
    plans_plan
GROUP BY 
    plan_type_id
ORDER BY 
    plan_count DESC;

2. Total Amount Saved by Plan Status
sql

SELECT 
    status_id, 
    SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM 
    plans_plan
GROUP BY 
    status_id
ORDER BY 
    total_amount DESC;

3. Most Recent Plans Created
sql

SELECT 
    name, 
    created_on, 
    amount
FROM 
    plans_plan
ORDER BY 
    created_on DESC
LIMIT 10;

4. Plans with Highest Goals
sql

SELECT 
    name, 
    goal
FROM 
    plans_plan
WHERE 
    goal > 0
ORDER BY 
    goal DESC
LIMIT 10;

5. Active Plans (assuming status_id=1 is active)
sql

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as active_plans
FROM 
    plans_plan
WHERE 
    status_id = 1;

6. Dollar Stash Plans Analysis
sql

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as dollar_stash_count,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM 
    plans_plan
WHERE 
    name = 'Dollar Stash';

7. Plans Created in the Last Year
sql

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as recent_plans
FROM 
    plans_plan
WHERE 
    created_on >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR);

8. Average Plan Amount by Currency
sql

SELECT 
    currency_id,
    AVG(amount) as avg_amount
FROM 
    plans_plan
GROUP BY 
    currency_id;
